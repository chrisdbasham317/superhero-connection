## Why'd I Do This?

This was a solo project for Turing School of Software and Design. It was a project used to display my understanding of the tech stack, workflow processes, and a chance to design/build an app born in my own mind. I love superheroes, and essentially anything "nerdy". SuperHero Battle allows me to express exactly that!
